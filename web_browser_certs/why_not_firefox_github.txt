(1) ok whether u use chrome or i.e. it works
and when you click "view certificates" in i.e.
or  when you click "Certificate information" in chrome
it pops up the same dialog, so they are using the same "thing".






Q: "The personal certificate can't be installed because you do not own the corresponding private key which was created when the certificate was requested" 

A: You first created the certificate with the first browser. That browser created the private key, and stored it hidden in the browser-profile. When you then got the certificate, it was merged with the private key, and made useable that way. (You might have seen a popup window saying "Generating Private Key": That was your browser when it generated the key) Afterwards you used a different browser (or a different user-profile, or a different computer, or you have deleted your profile in the mean time, formatted your harddisk or anything else like that), and tried to download the certificate again, but you don´t have the matching private key for the certificate, so your browser tells that you that the certificate isn´t of much use without the private key. 

Unfortunately, Firefox completely hides the private keys, you can´t see them anywhere in the settings. (Opera on the other hand shows the private keys. So feel free to send a feature-request to Firefox to add the feature of showing the private keys) 

So what you have to do: You have to backup/export the certificate+private key from the first browser/profile into a PKCS#12 file. (It´s protected with a password. Don´t mix up that password with the Master-Password of your Firefox Profile) Then you can copy that file to another computer/account/browser, and restore/import the PKCS#12 file again. PKCS#12 files are sometimes called *.p12 *.pkcs12 or *.pfx Microsoft usually only recognizes the .pfx extension, so you might have to rename it in case.
